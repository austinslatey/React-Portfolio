          Throughout my life, I've switched career roles a couple times now.
          First, I entered into the cooking universe. Here, I became skilled in
          cooking foods from scratch. This taught me to be paitent and delicate
          because the food we were serving was expensive. As cooks, were
          responsible to uphold the expectaion of quality food.
        </li>
        <li>
          Secondly, I entered into the automotive buisness to become a spray
          technician. The service I provide is a product called Rhino Lining.
          This product offers durable protection to a truck's bed without having
          to install anything or drilling into the truck bed. I've been with
          this company for a little under two years, and realized quickly that
          this wasnt the job for me. I started to mess around with coding, and I
          fell in love!
        </li>

          I became so interested, I decided to enroll in a Web Development coding bootcamp at the University of Minnesota. It was a good decision to educate myself further
          into the vast world of coding. With the knowledge I've used, I plan to
          advance into a full-stack web development career opportunity to work with a organization that suits the company and I best.
